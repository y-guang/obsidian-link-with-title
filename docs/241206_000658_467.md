# Note File Naming Conventions: UID Only

In systems like Obsidian, where Markdown files operate without a database, unique identifiers (UIDs) as file names are the optimal solution. This article explores why UIDs are superior compared to titles or hybrid naming conventions.

We say that base on two fact:

- Notes need reliable connections.
- Note contents evolve, and so do their titles.

## The Critical Role of File Names in Connecting Notes

In database-less systems, file names serve as the sole reference for linking notes. Technically, there are two ways to establish these connections:

```markdown
[Note Title](./path/to/note.md)
[[note file name]]
```

Both methods depend entirely on the file name. This dependency imposes two essential requirements for file names:

- Stability: Connections must remain reliable and robust, meaning file names should not change.
- Uniqueness: The second type of connection, the Wikilink, offers an advantage: it allows linking notes without requiring knowledge of file structure. This means notes can be moved around without breaking links. However, this method requires file names to be unique across the entire vault.

From this perspective, UIDs stand out as the ideal choice. They are inherently stable and unique. Conversely, including titles or other metadata in file names introduces instability. Titles often evolve as the content matures, and renaming a file could break existing links.

## Separating Storage from Display

A common argument against UID-only file names is that they lack descriptive information. For example:

```bash
- inbox 
	- 241206_000658_467 - Note File Naming Conventions.md
	- 241205_235122_264 - Johnny Decimal.md
```

may seem more informative than:

```bash
- inbox
	- 241206_000658_467
	- 241205_235122_264
```

It is true that the first one is more informative. However, this perspective **conflates storage with display**. 

For display purposes, the title can be managed more flexibly through tools or plugins. For example, my note title is displayed in following way with [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) Plugin in Obsidian: 

```bash
- inbox
	- Note File Naming Conventions - 241206_000658_467
	- Johnny Decimal - 241205_235122_264
```

The plugin automatically extracts the title from the header of the note and attaches the UID in the file name for informative display.

In fact, it is a good practice for **orthogonality**. The file name is for storage and connection, while the title is for display. This separation allows the title to evolve without affecting the connections.

## Why Not Auto-Updating Links?

Another valid doubt is: why not use tools to automatically rename links. It's true, and the answer is simple: that is a taste thing for data management rather than a technical one. 

Separating the identifier from the title and other metadata is a way to keeps high cohesion and Low coupling. When enabling auto-updating links, you may change over hundreds of notes for a single title change. I have two reasons to avoid this:

- As a guy values data integrity (ok, control freak actually), I prefer to have control over the changes. Rather than let software **change** data, I want them just view or **display** data. 
- More rationally, it also good for version control. If you have a version control system like Git, you can easily track change if title changes are made in the single file rather than all linked files.

## Benefitable Scenarios

With UID-only naming convention, we orthogonally separate following operations:

- Title changing
- Note linking
- File moving
- Folder restructuring

Then, in each scenario, we have no mental burden to consider the impact on other operations. 
## Drawback

So at what cost? 

The only drawback of this method is that it requires a bit more effort to manage the display. 

Fortunately, tools like [Front Matter Title](https://github.com/snezhig/obsidian-front-matter-title) Plugin in Obsidian make most process straightforward. For example, it can automatically extract the title from the header and display it in the side bar and graph view.

### Minor Inconvenience: Internal Links Display

For me, the only inconvenience is that the internal link cannot be automatically shown as its title. Some people suggest using the alias like:

```markdown
[[241206_000658_467 | Note File Naming Conventions]]
```

I have to admit that it is a good solution. Not only it makes the internal link more readable, but also it reflects how the referred note is viewed in current context.

However, I personally don't like this method because of the coupling. You should not assume the alias will be fixed. 

For example, at beginning I have a note called 'horse', and I refer it in the note 'beautiful items'. Later I realize I actually mean 'white horse'. The alias in the 'beautiful items' will not be automatically updated.

Overall, although it is minor inconvenience for me, [[241207_093347_025|developing plugin]] based on the render engine of Obsidian is a good solution.
